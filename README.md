# NIGERIA-AGRICULTURAL-EXPORT
### Project Overview : Analysing The Nigerian Agricultural Export (2021-2023)

This project focuses on analyzing Nigeria's agricultural exports, utilizing a dataset that captures detailed information on various products exported, the companies involved, and the financial metrics associated with these exports. The dataset contains crucial variables such as product names, export destinations, transportation modes, and economic figures like cost of goods sold (COGS), profit, and export value. By exploring this dataset, we aim to uncover insights into Nigeria's agricultural export patterns, identify key trends, and highlight areas for potential growth or improvement.
