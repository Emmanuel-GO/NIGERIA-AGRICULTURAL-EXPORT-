5. **Monitor External Factors**:
   - Changes in the global market, political or economic factors, or changes in cashew demand could explain some of the fluctuations. A broader analysis of external influences should guide future strategy adjustments.

## _Company Performance Analysis_

### Findings 

1. **Top Exporting Companies**: 
   The first image lists companies based on their export values, with **Agro Export Nigeria Ltd** leading at 186.79 billion in total export value and a matching total profit of 186.47 billion. Other key players include **Golden Farms Nigeria Limited** and **Prime Agro Exports Nigeria Limited**, also have significant contributions to both export value and profit.

2. **Profitability**: 
   Most companies listed show total profit values very close to their total export values, suggesting a high profit margin or efficiency in their export operations. For instance, the profit of **Prime Agro Exports Nigeria Limited** almost mirrors their export value, which indicates effective cost management and revenue generation.

3. **Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC)**: 
   The **NEPC** is a notable presence on the list with an export value of around 164 billion but does not have reported profit values, which suggests it might be a regulatory or promotional body rather than a revenue-focused entity.

4. **Range of Export Values**:
   Export values across companies range from 186 billion down to 149 billion, which highlights the competitiveness of these top-tier companies. However, the difference between the highest and lowest performers is not drastically large, indicating similar market shares among these key players.

5. **Slight Variances in Reporting**:
   The second table displays only the **Total Export Value** without the profit values. This might be a filtered or partial view of the report, focusing solely on export performance without diving into profitability metrics.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Analysis on Profit Margins**:
   A deeper analysis of the cost structures of these companies should be performed. The fact that their profit values closely mirror their export values suggests either optimized operations or hidden inefficiencies. Understanding the underlying cost can guide policy or business decisions.

2. **Investigate the Role of NEPC**:
   Since NEPC appears on the list but with no profit data, it would be beneficial to investigate its exact role in the export market. If NEPC is a facilitator or regulator, its impact on the overall export industry should be measured to assess whether it helps boost other companies' exports.

3. **Benchmarking Best Performers**:
   Companies like **Agro Export Nigeria Ltd** and **Golden Farms Nigeria Limited** could serve as case studies to understand their successful strategies in both exports and profitability. This benchmarking can provide insights into best practices in the export sector.

4. **Segment Profit and Export Data**:
   It would be beneficial to segment this data further by export product type or geographical region to understand better which sectors are driving these export values. Insights on the diversification of exports and market focus could be generated from this segmentation.

5. **Longitudinal Study**:
   If possible, examine these export and profit values over time to identify trends and forecast future performance. Identifying whether these companies have been growing or plateauing will guide strategic decisions for stakeholders.
